In order to run the model as is, you only need to change the names in 
the fileNames.scala file.  direct them as follows:
 melodyMatrixFileName is the file in which you will store the note transitions
 testFileDirectory  = is the file in which the trainig scv files are held.
 newSongFileName= is the name of the file in which you will store the new song
  chordMatrixFileName= the file in which you store the chord transitions
   timeMatrixFileName=the name of the file in which you will store the time transitions.
   
   change the length of the song in figModel if you want (variable is numIterations) it is currently at 100.
   
   Then run musicProsessing.figModel as you main file.  That is it.
